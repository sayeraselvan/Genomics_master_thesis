# maxENT Analysis Directory
This directory contains all scripts and resources used for ecological niche modeling with maxENT as part of my Masterâ€™s thesis in Genomics. The workflow is organized into sequential steps, from data preparation to final analysis and visualization.

#ðŸ“š Directory Structure & Script Descriptions
Each numbered folder/script corresponds to a step in the MaxEnt modeling pipeline:

#Folder/Scripts structure
```
1_downloadclimate	Scripts to download and prepare climate/environmental data for modeling
2_presencelocations	Processes species presence location data for input to MaxEnt.
3_environmentalvariables_uncorrelated_maxent	Selects uncorrelated environmental variables for robust modeling.
4_modelcalibrationarea_trainingarea	Defines calibration and training areas for model building and evaluation.
5_replicates	Runs maxENT models with multiple replicates for robustness and uncertainty estimation.
6_bestmodelselection	Identifies the best model(s) based on performance metrics and selection criteria.
7_finalmodelprojection	Projects the final selected model onto current or future environmental scenarios.
8_maskingwithicesheet	Applies post-processing masks (glacial ice sheets for the LGM) to refine model projections.
9_speciesarea_calculation	Calculates species area metrics from the projection outputs of the best model.
10_additionalanalysis_mess	Additional exploratory scripts
11_plots_maxent	visualizations of MaxEnt results.
```
