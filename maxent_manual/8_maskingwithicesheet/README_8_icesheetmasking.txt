maxENT modeling 

Step 8: icesheet masking to mask out the regions with glacial ice cover for Arabis alpina species distribution 

script used are present in the same folder named as mask_icesheet_EC.R, mask_icesheet_E.R, mask_icesheet_NE.R 

this script will take the outputs median.asc projection files for the  maxent and mask out the regions of glacial ice and the icesheet files are downloaded from the chelsea gobal climate database

All the output masked asc file are present in (/netscratch/dep_coupland/grp_fulgione/siva/final_maxent/final_model/Final_models/projection/results_copy_projections/EC_past/masked)
