Step 10 - Addtional mess analysis

Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS) Analysis and Most Dissimilar Variable (MoD) Analysis This determines the extent of the environmental differences between model training and model projection (extrapolation) data and which projection areas should be cautiously handled. The MoD shows the most dissimilar variable, i.e., the one furthest outside its training range. This was done on all projection scenarios attached in the appendix. This was done using the MaxENT software and R by comparing the training and projection areas.
