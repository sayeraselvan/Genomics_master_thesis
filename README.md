## Project Description

This repository contains the scripts, data files, and documentation associated with my Master's thesis in Genomics. The project focuses on analyzing genomic datasets to address biological questions related to:

- Adaptation
- Niche modeling
- Conservation genomics

The analyses combine next-generation sequencing (NGS) data processing with advanced statistical and ecological modeling.
