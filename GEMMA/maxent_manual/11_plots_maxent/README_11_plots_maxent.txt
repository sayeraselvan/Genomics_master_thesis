maxENT modelling, all the images are present in the 


the plots of maxent projection and species area are present in (/netscratch/dep_coupland/grp_fulgione/siva/final_maxent/plots_maxent)

this folder has three folder

(a) best_model_plots/ (other plots are based on model performance)
		|
		|
		|-> bio1_19/ (files here are the average of the replicate's individual environmental variables wrt the species presence)
		|	|
		|	|-> replicates/ (this has all the individual environmental variables wrt the probabilty of species presence based on the replicates from bootstraping)
		|
		|-> jacknife/ (average jacknife of the replicates)
		|	|
		|	|-> replicates/ (this is the jacknife of the individual replicate due to bootstrapping)
		|
		|-> roc (average roc of the replicates)
		|	|
		|	|-> replicates/ (this is the roc curve for individual replicate due to bootstrapping)

(b) projection_images_videos/ (this has all the images and videos for projction, the files are named accordingly where EC -> extrapolationn by clamping, E -> free extrapolation, NE -> no extrapolation)

(c) speciesareaplots/ (this folder has all the speciesarea plots and they are named after their file name and also these plots can be generated in Step 9 of maxent modelling with the help of plot_species.R according to our requirements..

Thank you! for going through my master project work on maxent, it is my great pleasure and i am grateful to all the support and guidance!
